# Exercise: Restricting the rows returned

We will now introduce another clause into the mix, the `WHERE` clause.  Use it along with an expression to tell the system which rows you do or do not want. The `WHERE` clause contains conditions to filter the returned rows. Rows which pass the filter conditions are allowed to be returned.  

Below are some examples of queries with a `WHERE` clause. Try and verbalize each `SELECT` statement as a sentence.  For example, the first statement below would read like this: “Grab every column of data from the **individual** table where the individual’s last name is equal to `‘Jennings’`.  

- Run the following `SELECT` statements in either mysql client or Workbench.  When you are done, save the work in your 'select exercise' file and push to GitHub.

  0. SELECT * FROM individual WHERE LastName = 'Jennings';
  0. SELECT ID, LASTNAME FROM individual WHERE DeceasedDate IS NOT NULL;
  0. SELECT ID, LastName, BirthDate FROM individual WHERE Year(BirthDate) > 1940;
  0. SELECT * FROM individual WHERE ID IN (1,3,5,7,19);

> Question:  Are table names case sensitive?  Are column names?

- Put the queries into your 'select exercise' file.  
- Save and commit your changes
- Push your changes to your fork on Github.
