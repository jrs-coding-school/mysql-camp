Exercise 7:  UPDATE Statement
1.	Create an UPDATE statement that attempts to set the ID column on all the rows in the Ramones table to NULL.  Did you receive an error?  Why did the statement succeed/fail?
2.	Create an UPDATE statement that attempts to set the ID column on all the rows in the Ramones table to 5. Did you receive an error?  Why did the statement succeed/fail?
3.	Create an UPDATE statement that sets the ID column equal to 5 where the first name is equal to ‘Dee Dee’;  Did you receive an error?  Should you SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0 ?  How many rows would be updated if you disabled safe mode?  Is this UPDATE statement a good idea?
4.	Alter the Band table by adding a new column named ‘Era’.  The column  should be defined with a data type of ENUM that allows a value of either ‘Classic’ or ‘Modern’.
5.	Create and run an UPDATE statement that updates values the Era column to ‘Classic’ where the YearFormed is less than or equal to 1970.
6.	Create and run an additional UPDATE statement that updates values the Era column to ‘Modern’ where the YearFormed is greater than 1970.
