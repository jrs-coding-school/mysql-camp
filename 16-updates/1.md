# Exercise:  UPDATE Statement

- Create an `UPDATE` statement that attempts to set the **ID** column on all the rows in the **Ramones** table to `NULL`.  Did you receive an error?  Why did the statement succeed/fail?
- Create an `UPDATE` statement that attempts to set the **ID** column on all the rows in the **Ramones** table to a value of 5. Did you receive an error?  Why did the statement succeed/fail?
- Create an `UPDATE` statement that sets the **ID** column equal to 5 where the first name is equal to ‘Dee Dee’;  Did you receive an error?  Should you `SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;`?  How many rows would be updated if you disabled safe mode?  Is this `UPDATE` statement a good idea?
- Alter the **Band** table by adding a new column named **Era**.  The column should be defined with a data type of `ENUM` that allows a value of either "Classic" or "Modern".
- Create and run an `UPDATE` statement that updates values the **Era** column to "Classic" where the **YearFormed** is less than or equal to 1970.
- Create and run an additional `UPDATE` statement that updates values the **Era** column to "Modern" where the **YearFormed** is greater than 1970.
