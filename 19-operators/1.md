# Exercise: `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL` comparison operators.

Let's practice the `BETWEEN`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL` comparison operators.

Create some `SELECT` statements that explore the `individual` table.   Each `SELECT` statement should pull the `ID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, BIRTHDATE,` and `DECEASEDDATE` columns.  Each `SELECT` statement should accomplish the following:

1. Retrieve people who aren’t dead.
1. Retrieve people who are missing a birth date.
1. Retrieve people who are NOT missing a birth date.
1. Retrieve people who were born in the 1940’s.  Hint: Use the `YEAR()` function.  
1. Retrieve people whose last name starts with the letters ‘A’ through ‘D’.  Hint:  The last name  ‘Deal’ is greater than ‘D’.
