# Exercise: HAVING

- Create three select statements that use the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clause.  Use any table or view from any of the databases created to this point.  Feel free to create your own database and tables with data, if you desire.

- Save the SQL to a SQL file named **(Your last name)-having.SQL**.  

  Example: **ottinger-having.sql**

- Save your new file to your local **mysql-camp-student** repo's **student-exercises** folder.  
- Commit and push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
