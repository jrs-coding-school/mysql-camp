# Exercise: More fun with joins

- Create a `SELECT` statement that joins the **player** table and the **batting** table.  The query should _show all the players_ and any matching players that exist within the **batting** table.  You should see `NULL` when there are no matches in the **batting** table.

- Create a `SELECT` statement that joins the **roster** table and the **team** table.   The query should display all the teams and any matching players within the **roster** table. You should see `NULL` when there are no matches in the **roster** table.

- Create a query that shows teams that have players on a roster.  If a team does not have any players on a roster, then do not display the team.  

- Create a query that displays teams that do not have players on a roster.
