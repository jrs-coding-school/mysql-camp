# Exercise: Aliases

Create a `SELECT` statement with an expression that uses a column alias.

- Let’s start with a simple query that retrieves every column from the **BandMembers** view.

```
mysql> USE RockStarDay2;
mysql> SELECT * FROM BandMembers;
```

- Alter the `SELECT` statement to combine the **FirstName** and **LastName** columns as a new column aliased as **FullName**. We’ll use the `CONCAT()` function to concatenate two columns together to form a single string. Try this:

```
mysql> SELECT LastName , FirstName, CONCAT(FirstName, ‘ ‘ , LastName) as FullName FROM BandMembers;
```

- Use the `YEAR()` function to return the year for a bandmember’s birthdate.  We will alias the new column as ‘birthyear’.

```
mysql> SELECT LastName , FirstName, YEAR(birthdate) as BirthYear FROM BandMembers;
```

- Using the **baseball** database, return all the players on the Boston Red Sox. Use table aliases within the query.
