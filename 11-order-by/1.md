1.	Create a `SELECT` statement that joins the **team** table to the **batting** table using the team's **ID** column.   Be sure to include the **batting.BattingAvg**, **batting.ID**, **team.TeamName** columns.  The results should look something like this:

  ![Order By List Players height descending](/static/assets/img/order-by4.png)

2.	Build on the previous query that sorts the result set by batting average.  The highest batting averages should be listed first.   The results should look similar to this:

3.  Run the following query: `SELECT * FROM baseball.vbattingleaders;`.  Review the result set.  Create additional queries each fulfilling the following requirements:
  - Which players have the most hits?  Display the player's first name, last name, team abbreviation, and hits.  The players with the most hits should be sorted at the top of the list.
  - Which players have the least hits?  Display the player's first name, last name, team abbreviation, and hits.  The players with the least hits should be sorted at the top of the list.
  - Sort the players by team. Within each team, sort the hitters with the most AtBats.
