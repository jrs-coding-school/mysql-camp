# Exercise:

Since a view is a virtual table, you can join a view to another view or to another table.  As far as a SELECT statement and JOINs are concerned, you can treat a view just like it was a table.

- Open MySQL Workbench and connect using your credentials.
- Within Workbench open a new SQL tab by selecting **File > New Query Tab or Command + T** from the main menu.  

## Query 1 ##  

- Retrieve all the columns from the **vteamRoster** view for only the batting leaders. To accomplish this, create a query that joins the **batting** table to the **vteamRoster** view using the **playerID** column for the join.

## Query 2 ##  

- Make a copy of the first query and place it below the first query.  Modify the new query to determine the average weight of the batting leaders by division.

## Query 3 ##   

- Create a query that returns all rows from just the **vteamRoster** view.

## Query 4 ##

- Create a query that counts the number of players within the **vteamRoster** view _by position_.
  > Hint, you will find that you have 4 right fielders (RF) and 2 center fielders (CF).

- Save the 4 queries to a SQL file named **(Your last name)-groupby.SQL**.  

  Example: **ottinger-groupby.sql**

- Save your new file to your local **mysql-camp-student** repo's **student-exercises** folder.  
- Commit and push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
