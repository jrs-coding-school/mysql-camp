# Exercise: Building a many-to-many relationship

We donâ€™t want to allow an entry of rows into the **IndividualBand** table unless the Individual's **ID** and the Band's **ID** area known in the **Individual** and **Band** tables.  To enforce this we can create 2 foreign key relationships.  The first foreign key relationship will be between the **Individual** and **IndividualBand** tables and a second foreign key relationship will be placed between the **Band** and **IndividualBand** tables.  

0.	Using the table below as a guide, build the **IndividualBand** table.  Each foreign key column will require an index.  Also be sure to _check the data types on the primary key columns_ on the parent tables, especially whether the `INT` data type is `UNSIGNED` or `SIGNED`.  Each foreign key will require a cascade delete and cascade update.
