# Exercise: Relate Band to Album

Letâ€™s create the **Album** table that tracks an **ID** for the primary key, **Name**, **AlbumYear**, and a **BandID** column to support the foreign key to the **Band** table.    The table looks like this.  The trick is the **BandID** column. It requires the same data type of the parent column that you are relating it to.  If the parent column is an unsigned `INT` then child column will need to be an unsigned `INT`.  You will need to add an index for the **BandID** column.

0. Run the following SQL data definition language (DDL) statement to add the **Album** table to the database.

```
CREATE TABLE Album (
ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
, Name varchar(50) NOT NULL
, AlbumYear Year(4) NOT NULL
, BandID INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL
, INDEX BandID_IDX(BandID)
, FOREIGN KEY (BandID) REFERENCES Band(ID) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
